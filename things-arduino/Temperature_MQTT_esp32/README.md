#Light contol and temperature sensor (end-device)

This code project implements an ESP32-based end-point device which controls a light in the smart home application (light is currently simulated by a built-in LED). This device also incorporate a temperature sensor wwhich takes the environment temperature and sends it to the MQTT server.

## Installing the firmware
to install the firmware into the ESP32 WROOMxx you should perform the following tasks:
- Download the Arduino software
- Install the ESP32 board information into the Arduino ([enlace](http://TODO))
- Install the required arduino libraries to compile the program.
